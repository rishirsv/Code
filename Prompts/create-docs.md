## Template

### Project Structure & Module Organization

- Outline the project structure, including where the source code, tests, and assets are located.

Example:
```text
project/
├── .taskmaster/
│   ├── tasks/              # Task files directory
│   │   ├── tasks.json      # Main task database
│   │   ├── task-1.md      # Individual task files
│   │   └── task-2.md
│   ├── docs/              # Documentation directory
│   │   ├── prd.txt        # Product requirements
│   ├── reports/           # Analysis reports directory
│   │   └── task-complexity-report.json
│   ├── templates/         # Template files
│   │   └── example_prd.txt  # Example PRD template
│   └── config.json        # AI models & settings
├── .env                   # API keys

```

### Build, Test, and Development Commands

- List key commands for building, testing, and running locally (e.g., npm test, make build).
- Briefly explain what each command does.

### Workflow
Development tasks for features follow the following workflow unless otherwise specified.
- Create a PRD using `@create-prd.md`. Ask the user clarifying questions and save `docs/PRDs/prd-<slug>.md`.
- Generate tasks using `@generate-tasks.md` on `prd-<slug>.md`. Parse the PRD document and save `/docs/tasks/tasks-<slug>.md`. Ask the user if they are ready to generate subtasks.
- On confirmation, generate subtasks and metadata.
- Focus on one task at a time and methodically complete tasks using `process-task-list.md`.

These are the relevant workflow files:
- **`create-prd.md`**: Guides the AI in generating a Product Requirement Document for your feature.
- **`generate-tasks.md`**: Takes a PRD markdown file as input and helps the AI break it down into a detailed, step-by-step implementation task list.
- **`process-task-list.md`**: Instructs the AI on how to process the generated task list, tackling one task at a time and waiting for your approval before proceeding. (This file also contains logic for the AI to mark tasks as complete).

The user may also request the following workflows:
- **bug-fix.md**: Modify code only related to the bug description.

#### Bug fix
```
Role: Bug fix assistant for <project-folder>.
Only change code related to bug <desc>.

Allowed git: same as Feature. Additionally: `git cherry-pick` if needed.
Steps:
1) Reproduce locally; add a failing test if easy.
2) Branch `fix/<issue#>-<slug>`.
3) Minimal fix; commit `fix(scope): one-line summary`.
4) Prove fix (test or reproducible steps); open PR.

Confirm before:
- Any deletion >20 lines.
- Any dependency changes.
```

#### Refactor 
```
Goal: Improve readability/structure without changing outputs.
Guardrails:
- No API signatures changed. No public types changed.
- Commit as `refactor(scope): ...`.
- Run tests before/after; attach diffstat and test logs.
```

#### Code Review
```
Review git history for recent code changes. 

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Recent changes: !`git diff HEAD~1`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -5`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`

Perform a comprehensive code review focusing on:

1. **Code Quality**: Check for readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices
2. **Security**: Look for potential vulnerabilities or security issues
3. **Performance**: Identify potential performance bottlenecks
4. **Testing**: Assess test coverage and quality
5. **Documentation**: Check if code is properly documented

Provide specific, actionable feedback with line-by-line comments where appropriate.
```

#### Conflict resolution
```
Task: Resolve merge/rebase conflicts on branch <name>.
Rules:
- Never edit generated/compiled assets; fix the source.
- For ambiguous conflicts, propose both options in comments.
- After resolution: run tests; then `git add -A && git rebase --continue` (or commit merge).
- If conflicts explode: `git rebase --abort` and ask for help.
```

#### Merge preparation
```
Task: Prepare PR for merge.
Steps:
1) `git fetch` then `git rebase origin/main`.
2) Ensure tests and lint pass.
3) Summarize changes, risk, and rollback in the PR description.
Do NOT merge; leave that to me.
```

### Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- Specify indentation rules, language-specific style preferences, and naming patterns.
- Include any formatting or linting tools used.

### Testing Guidelines

- Identify testing frameworks and coverage requirements.
- State test naming conventions and how to run tests.

### Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Summarize commit message conventions found in the project's Git history.
- Outline pull request requirements (descriptions, linked issues, screenshots, etc.).
